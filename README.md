# 2D Action Platformer Game
This was a personal project I started with a couple of friends of mine to build competency in the Unity game engine. We established the basic skeleton of the game's mechanics over summer, and I continued to work on the game and document my progress as a capstone to my senior year of college.
## Game Concept
Our concept, for how the game would play, was based on mixing aspects and themes from several of our favorite games. The ideal final product would be a 2D action platformer akin to something like *Hollow Knight*. This type of game was the core of what we were looking for: a 2D platformer where you fight enemies while balancing health and mana. However, we also wanted to incorporate a stealth aspect to the game. Inspirations for this idea came primarily from games like *Dishonored* and *Gunpoint*. We wanted to emulate the dynamic switching of playstyles, between aggressive and sneaky, that players often have to do in games like *Dishonored*.
## Final Product
While working on the project, it became apparent our scope was perhaps too large for a first game project. This fact became even more apparent when I began working solo on the project. By the time I was done with work on the project, the result was more of a tech demo or a proof of concept than an actual game.

Though I did not fulfill the goal of making a full game that adequately blended the genres that I wanted, I learned a great deal about designing games and working with Unity. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, I learned a great deal about how to design and manage project plans.
